## Info ##

(for my laptops) personal collection of config files for my Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking Awesome Window Manager "rice", but on occasion, I also use the Xfce4 desktop environment.

I am no longer maintaining the "t450" and "Macbook5,5" branches of this repo since I do not have these devices anymore. However, I will not be deleting said branches from the repo, for archival purposes 😌

Thanks for checking out my GNU/Linux dotfiles 😊
